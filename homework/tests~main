Homework after tests-lecture:
1. write unit tests for:
 test_simple_calc.py + test_simple_employee.py
2. if you want more challenge, write tests for test_complex.py
Use SetUp, TearDown methods, Mock(), patch etc.
Note: pay attention to names of test methods, and make sure each method tests one thing only!


Homework after tests-practice:
Get to know what is test coverage (https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
and check code coverage for your tests - try to increase the coverage for your unit tests as much as possible.
